**Molecular Generation using Graph Neural Networks**

**Background**

Recently, I've become fascinated with graph networks and understanding their inner workings. In light of this interest, I'm attempting to create something similar to Graph Network Dojo, which will contain implementations of various graph layers and models. This project serves as a practical way for me to deepen my understanding of how these networks function.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent a novel type of neural network architecture that operates on a graph-in, graph-out principle. The input to the model is a graph, which is processed and transformed into an output graph. This output maintains the same structure as the input, but with modified node and edge embeddings. These transformed graphs can then be utilized for various downstream tasks such as link prediction, node classification, or edge classification.

There are several variants of graph models, each processing the input graph differently. However, the three main approaches that have gained significant attention in recent years and have produced state-of-the-art models are Message Passing, Convolution, and Attention. While this provides a brief overview of graph networks, I recommend reading the in-depth articles on Distill.pub for a more comprehensive introduction to GNNs.

**Introduction**

In my quest to learn more about GNNs, I've been exploring various applications to implement. Having previously attempted to implement HAMD, a GNN designed to solve the Hamiltonian cycle problem, I gained confidence in my abilities and decided to tackle a published paper. During this search, I encountered the concept of molecule generation. After investigating different approaches, I was particularly intrigued by Xavier Bresson's two-step decoder method and chose to implement it.

Throughout this process, I found Chaitanya Joshi's blogs and projects to be incredibly helpful resources. However, despite this guidance, I still encountered numerous challenges while attempting to implement the model. This project has proven to be an excellent learning experience, pushing me to overcome various obstacles and deepen my understanding of both GNNs and molecular generation techniques.

**Model Architecture and Implementation Challenges**

As I delved deeper into implementing Xavier Bresson's two-step decoder method for molecular generation, I encountered a series of fascinating challenges that pushed me to better understand the intricacies of graph neural networks and variational autoencoders.

The core of the model consists of an encoder that processes input molecular graphs and maps them to a latent space, and a two-step decoder that first generates node features and then edge features to reconstruct the molecular graph. While the high-level architecture seemed straightforward, the devil was truly in the details.

One of the first hurdles I faced was with the edge loss function. Initially, the model kept predicting that all bond types were "None". This was likely due to the prevalence of padding edges with no bond types in the dataset. It highlighted the importance of carefully considering how we represent and process the graph structure, especially when dealing with molecules where the number of actual bonds is typically much less than the total possible edges in a complete graph.

The node loss function, on the other hand, showed more promising results early on. After just a couple of epochs, the model went from predicting hundreds of nodes per graph to a much more reasonable number. This quick improvement was encouraging, but it also made me realize the complexity of balancing different components of the loss function.

A particularly vexing issue arose when I noticed that all random inputs to the decoder were producing the same output - specifically, a node count vector of \[10, 7, 0, 1, 0\]. This uniform output, regardless of input, pointed to a fundamental problem in either the model architecture or the training process. After much hair-pulling and debug sessions that stretched into the wee hours of the morning, I finally uncovered the culprit: a simple indexing error in the create_atom_count_vector() function. I was calculating count vectors for all molecules in the batch using only the first molecule's data. It was a facepalm moment that reminded me of the importance of rigorous testing and the sneaky nature of bugs in complex models. This seemingly minor fix had a dramatic impact on the model's behaviour, allowing it to finally produce diverse outputs for different inputs.

Another significant challenge was balancing the various components of the loss function, particularly the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. I noticed that the KL loss kept decreasing, even going below zero at times. While this led to an overall decrease in the total loss, the reconstruction loss (both for edges and nodes) wasn't improving significantly. This imbalance pointed to the need for a more sophisticated approach to handling the KL term.

After some research, I implemented KL annealing - a technique where the weight of the KL term is gradually increased during training. This helped stabilise the training process and led to more balanced improvements across all components of the loss.

However, I soon realized that the annealing needed to be even more gradual. The sudden decrease in loss when beta jumped from 0 to 0.15 indicated that a smoother increase in beta might lead to better results.

The edge prediction task presented its own set of challenges. Due to the nature of molecular graphs, where most potential edges are actually non-bonds, the model tended to be biased towards predicting no bonds. To address this, I implemented class weighting in the cross-entropy loss for edge type prediction, giving more importance to the less frequent bond types.

As I continued to refine the model, I experimented with different architectural choices. For instance, I found that using residual connections (x = x + a, edge_attr = edge_attr + b) seemed to produce better outputs than my initial approach. This highlighted the importance of allowing information to flow more freely through the network, especially in deep graph neural networks.

The journey of implementing this molecular generation model has been a rollercoaster of eureka moments and frustrating roadblocks. Each challenge overcome has deepened my understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations of working with graph neural networks and variational autoencoders.

As I continue to refine the model, there are still several areas I'm exploring:

1. Further tuning of the KL annealing process to achieve a more stable and effective training regime.
2. Investigating the impact of latent space dimensionality on model performance and interpretability.
3. Developing a more intuitive and effective edge loss function that better captures the nuances of molecular bond structures.
4. Exploring techniques for latent space disentanglement to potentially improve the interpretability and controllability of the generated molecules.

This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of perseverance and attention to detail in machine learning research. As I continue to refine this model and explore new applications of graph neural networks, I'm excited to see where this journey will lead next.
