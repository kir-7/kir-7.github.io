Hey there! I am Kireeti, a second year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about Software development and Artificial Intelligence. I have developed an interest in machine learning and since have been self learning and building projects.

I have started this blog as a means for me to share my thoughts and connect with others.

Other than software development my interests also include music, anime and finance.

### Projects

Although most of my projects dont follow open source spirit and are not documented properly, these still work and are a way for me to learn.

* [Open-set Face verification](https://github.com/kir-7/Openset-Face-Verification)
* [PINNs for Harmonic Oscillator](https://github.com/kir-7/HarmonicOscillator)
* [Image colorization using GANs](https://github.com/kir-7/Image-Colorization)
* [A* path finding visualizer](https://github.com/kir-7/A_star-pathfinding)
