Hey there! I am Kireeti, a third year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about Software development and Artificial Intelligence. I have developed an interest in machine learning and since have been self learning and building projects.

I have started this blog as a means for me to share my thoughts and connect with others.

Other than software development my interests also include music, anime and finance.

### Projects

Most of my projects don't follow open source spirit and are not documented properly.
